<P>
If you think you've discovered a bug, please first check to see if it is already known by looking at the list of already reported bugs.  You can do so by visiting the buglist at <A HREF=http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/buglist.cgi?product=libtiff>http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=libtiff</A>.

list for users of this software is located at olympiakos.com If you
